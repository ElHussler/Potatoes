Write MATLAB program to detect potatoes in provided images
Result:	Original image with potatoes surrounded by green Minimum Enclosing Rectangle (MER)
	Display stats in Command Window (Gonzalez and Woods’ "Representation and Description"):
	1) Number of potatoes detected;
	2) Per potato, in a table (one row per potato):
	 a) (x,y) location of the centroid of the potato;
	 b) the eccentricity of the potato;
	 c) the mean and standard deviation of the R, G and B colour values in the potato.
	 d) the smoothness value of the potato;
	 e) the average entropy of the potato.
